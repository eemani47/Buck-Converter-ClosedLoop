# Buck-Converter-ClosedLoop
Simulink model of a closed-loop buck converter using IGBT switching and PID control.
# Closed-Loop Buck Converter â€“ Simulink Project

This is a MATLAB/Simulink project where I built and simulated a closed-loop buck converter using IGBT switching and a PID controller. The goal was to dynamically regulate the output voltage even when the input voltage or load conditions change. The converter was tuned for a fast response and minimal output ripple.

 What I Did

- Designed a buck converter in Simulink using power electronics components
- Implemented PWM switching using an IGBT block
- Used a PID controller to automatically adjust duty cycle in real time
- Tuned the system to maintain the output around 12V under varying input and load
- Observed stable performance and ripple-free regulation in simulation
